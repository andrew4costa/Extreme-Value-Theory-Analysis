# Extreme-Value-Theory-Analysis (EVT)

A project as a part of the Applied Forecasting course hosted by the University of Nicosia.

The purpose of this project was to explore bitcoin's price against the USD, performing different statistical tests to understand its returns and losses.

EVT was selected as a tool because its robust in dealing with data that has heavy tails.

The conclusions were that:
- bitcoin itself had all moments of its distrubtion converging, therefore implying that it was not fat-tailed
- bitcoin returns had its first two moments converging, but its third and fourth moments converging much slower
- the third and fourth moments for bitcoin losses did not converge (i.e. being undefined) and hence are fat-tailed
